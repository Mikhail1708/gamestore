shop of computer games, non production, it`s my practical work

This project is just for learning and a hobby, but I really enjoy making stuff like this.
I know the code is pretty bad, there are lots of glitches and things don’t always work right, but I’m not gonna give up on it. 
I’ll keep learning and slowly improve the code and how it runs. 
I would be very grateful if you could point out my mistakes and suggest what I should learn to correct them.

Best regards,
Mikel`
